      <p>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Bruno - the solo developer behind Countryzinho.</p>

      <p>
        I built this game as a fun side project because I'm learning the countries of the world and
        love challenges. The idea is simple: input as many countries as you can before time runs
        out.
      </p>

      <p>
        Countryzinho is still a work in progress, and I'm planning to add multiplayer soon. If you
        like playing it and would be interested in a multiplayer version, please reach out to me
        directly at
        <a href="mailto:bruno11.francisco@gmail.com" class="underline">my email</a> or
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bfrancisco11/" target="_blank" class="underline">

      </p>

      <p>Thanks so much for taking the time to play Countryzinho - really means a lot.</p>
